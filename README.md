# FallDetectorApp
App to detect injurious falls
Developed primarily while I was in high school (2018) 
final_fall_data.csv includes roughly 800 fall data points that I personally collected on a OnePlus3 that includes
Accelometer and Gyrometer data in 3 dimension and the data label (1 for Fall , 0 for Not Fall)
