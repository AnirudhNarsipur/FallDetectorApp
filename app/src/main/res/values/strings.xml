    <string name="Explainer" formatted="true" >The app uses machine learning to automatically detect if you fall. There is no need for you to configure any settings and an alarm
        will automatically go off if you fall. Just keep in mind to let the app run in the background for detection to happen! If there\'s a false alarm or help has arrived you can press the STOP ALARM button after which it will take some time to reset</string>
